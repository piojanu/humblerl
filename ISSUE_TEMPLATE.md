## Your issue should contain:

### What is the issue all about?
Write detailed description what is the problem *(in case of e.g. bug)*, what should be implemented *(in case of e.g. enhancement)* or what do you want to know *(in case of e.g. questions)*.

### What is the definition of done?
It should always be clear, where is the end of the work. It shouldn't be changed often too! If scope changes or more work needs to be done, it's better to end current issues and start new one, so we don't end up with never ending story (or issue :smile:).

### Next steps...
Clear next physical steps to push issue forward e.g. "Implement 'Dog' class [...]", "Contact Mark to [...]", "Find paper about [...]", "Read/Watch [...]". You can **sometimes** omit this part if next steps are obvious *(e.g. you have a question to be answered)* or you really don't want to/can't suggest first steps to solution.
